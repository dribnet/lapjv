LAPJV code by Jonker and Volgenant
==================================

An implementation of the LAPJV algorithm [1].

 Problems", Computing 38, 325-340 (1987)

Changes
-------

The code here is not the original version from authors' website. To my
knowledge, there are three changes:
  1. usage of double precision floating-point numbers for costs, and
  2. a different test for the decrease in the objective that prevents endless
     loop when the optimization gets close to the machine precision (thanks to
     Michael Lewis)
  3. switch from C++ to c to make compilation simpler (only needed: C++
     new/delete -> C malloc/free)
